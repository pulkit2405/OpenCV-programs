# OpenCV-programs
This repository contains multiple programs where one can gather information about the basic working of OpenCV modules. This include the methods which we use to get different properties about a given picture and can we tamper those pictures to get our desired product. 

In addition to that you will find a folder where you can find the face recognition program where it identifies whether its a picture of a person or not. It also return the number of people in the photo.
